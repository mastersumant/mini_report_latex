\textit{Blind people faces many problems in our society. So, an idea comes up in mind with some solution for the problems they are facing. As they are blind, they are not able to read the \textbf{\textit{medicine}} name and they always depends on other person or care taker for help.\\Some of the people took advantage of their disability and cheat them by taking \textbf{\textit{extra money}} or by giving \textbf{\textit{less money}}.\\Then the problem is how to make them independent in terms of \textbf{\textit{medicine and cash transaction} process}.\\To overcome the problem of \textbf{\textit{blind persons}} there is an innovative idea, where by making use of \textbf{\textit{machine learning, image processing, OpenCV, Django, TTS and OCR}} technologies to develop a software assistant using \textbf{\textit{Talkback and VoiceOver}} feature in android and iOS device which will guide the blind peoples and makes their life more comfortable.\\In this project make use of a camera of a device for getting the input, where the inputs are pictures of \textbf{\textit{medicine}} and of \textbf{\textit{currency}}. These images can be manipulated and enhanced by using \textbf{\textit{image processing}} and  \textbf{\textit{OpenCV}} tools in \textbf{\textit{Python}}. Once the processed imaged is obtained then it is cropping and thresholding is done, In the next stage for medicine detection part extraction of medicine name took place, then conversion of text into speech using \textbf{\textit{TTS}} technology took place and the output is obtained.\\Similarly, for currency detection the picture of currency is taken and then \textbf{\textit{image processing}} and \textbf{\textit{machine learning}} algorithms are taken place to compare the input currency picture with predefined database of each currency that has already been prepared. Then the next process is to covert the value of currency into text and then the text is converted into speech using \textbf{\textit{TTS}} technology and output is given.}
